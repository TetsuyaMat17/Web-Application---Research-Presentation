Hey guys

Can you provide me some feedback on my Problems document. I am kind of stuck in looking for problems with the archetectural layout of the
first website Jason has mentioned "Pennyjuice"

I was going to write about how the hyperlinks are not good but in fact they look decent as they are on a stand selling drinks so not sure 
how to critise it :) 

Maybe if you can comment on some problems that you see with design of the site would be great!

Thanks
